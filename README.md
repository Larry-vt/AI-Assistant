# AI-Assistant
Scope:
for this project I will like to start out simple. I want to create a basic AI assistant that can perform specific tasks, such as open applications such as spotify, discord, Google chrome, etc. As well as web browse for information and perform tasks such as writing and sending messages.

as this project progresses I would also like to add some machine Learning and other advanced AI to this project, such as voice and facial regonition. It would also be nice to have code that can be uploaded to external device such as arduino, raspberry pi, etc and have it become its own independant robot. 

future aspects I would like to experiment with would be emotion regonition, in face, body and voice. also to try and get the AI itself to express emotion. if this can become acomplished I would like to see how this affects the AI assistance functions. 
this is a bit advanced for my current level of coding and programming knowledge but for future reference to try and look at it might be interesting to investigate.
